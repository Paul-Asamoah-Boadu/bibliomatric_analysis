	abstract = {Today, energy conservation is more and more stressed as great amounts of energy are being consumed for varying applications. This study aimed to evaluate the application of two robust evolutionary algorithms, namely genetic algorithm (GA) and imperialist competition algorithm (ICA) for optimizing the weights and biases of the artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) in the estimation of heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) of the energy-eﬃcient residential buildings. To this end, a proper dataset was provided composed of relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, glazing area distribution, as the HL and CL inﬂuential factors. The optimal structure of each model was achieved through a trial and error process and to evaluate the accuracy of the designed networks, we used three well-known accuracy criterions. As the result of applying GA and ICA, the performance error of ANN decreased respectively by 17.92\% and 23.22\% for the HL, and 21.13\% and 24.53\% for CL in the training phase, and 20.84\% and 23.74\% for HL, and 27.57\% and 29.10\% for CL in the testing phase. The mentioned results demonstrate the superiority of the ICA-ANN model compared to GA-ANN and ANN.},

	abstract = {This article presents a new methodology to disaggregate the energy demand for space heating (SH) and domestic hot water (DHW) production from single hourly smart heat meters installed in Denmark. The new approach is idealized to be easily applied to several building typologies without the necessity of in-depth knowledge regarding the dwellings and their occupants. This paper introduces, tests, and compares several algorithms to separate and estimate the SH and DHW demand. To validate the presented methodology, a dataset of 28 Danish apartments with detailed energy monitoring (separated SH and DHW usage) is used. The comparison shows that the best method to identify energy demand data points corresponding to DHW production events is the so-called “maximum peaks” approach. Furthermore, the best algorithm to estimate the SH and DHW separately is a combination of two methods: the Kalman filter and the Support Vector Regression (SVR). This new methodology outperforms the current Danish compliances typically used to estimate the annual DHW usage in residential buildings.},

	abstract = {Building energy consumption prediction plays a key role in energy-efficiency decision making. With the advancement in data analytics, a number of machine learning-based building energy consumption prediction models have been developed in recent years. However, existing prediction models do not sufficiently take occupant behavior into account. Towards addressing this gap, this paper presents a machine-learning approach for predicting building energy consumption in an occupant-behavior-sensitive manner. In this approach, a model learns from a large set of energy-use cases that were modelled and simulated in EnergyPlus. The machinelearning prediction model was trained using a large dataset that includes 3-month hourly data for 5760 energy-use cases representing different combinations of building characteristics, outdoor weather conditions, and occupant behaviors. In developing the model, four machine-learning algorithms were tested and compared in terms of their prediction accuracy and computational efficiency: classification and regression trees (CART), ensemble bagging trees (EBT), artificial neural networks (ANN), and deep neural networks (DNN). The simu­ lation results demonstrated the high impact of the variables considered in this study. For example, the highest energy-consuming case consumed over 3432 times more energy than the lowest-consuming case. Occupant behavior made a difference up to over 7 times in energy consumption. The DNN model with four hidden layers achieved 2.97\% coefficient of variation (CV). Such high performance shows the potential of the proposed approach. The approach could help better understand the impact of occupant behavior on building energy consumption and identify opportunities for behavioral energy-saving measures.},

While global warming-driven changes of ecosystems could have multiple impacts on the built environment (most prominently on building energy demand and related urban energy systems), the building sector presents signiﬁcant potential for climate change mitigation. Study ﬁndings indicate that building renovations have signiﬁcant potential for the mitigation of urban-related emissions and achieving the sustainability goals set. However, these measures should be adapted to different climate conditions and different segments of the building stock. In developed countries, where the majority of the building stock is older than 50 years, more effort should be invested into creating adequate policies for the renovation of existing building stock. In developing countries with rapid growth in the urban environment, due to a previous lack of energy-efﬁciency policies, the focus should be on policy development and an increase in environmental awareness among building owners/tenants. Moreover, additional research efforts should be invested into performing technoeconomic and environmental analyses of green wall performance under future climate conditions, especially within the hot and humid climates.},

One aspect of energy efficiency in particular, the prediction of thermal loads (specifically heating and cooling), plays a significant role in reducing the costs associated with energy use and in minimising the risks associated with climate change. Recently, data‑driven ap‑proaches, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, have provided cost‑effective and high‑quality solutions for solving energy efficiency problems. This research inves‑tigates various ML methods for predicting energy efficiency in buildings, with a particular empha‑sis on heating and cooling loads. The review includes many ML techniques, including ensemble learning, support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), statistical models, and probabilistic models. Existing studies are analysed and compared in terms of new criteria, includ‑ing the datasets used, the associated platforms, and, more importantly, the interpretability of the models generated. The results show that, despite the problem under investigation being studied using a range of ML techniques, few have focused on developing interpretable classifiers that can be exploited by stakeholders to support the design of energy‑efficient residential buildings for climate impact minimisation. Further research in this area is required.},

	abstract = {Global warming is one metric of climate change which is defined as an increase in the average global temperature. Residential buildings contribute significantly to the pollution that causes climate change. It is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the functions of highly energy efficient buildings in view of projected climate projections, the quality of their heating systems, and the impact on human health and well-being. Thus, in this study, the effects of six input variables which are Overall Height, Glazing Area, Wall Area, Relative Compactness, Roof Area, and Glazing Area Distribution on one output variable, namely Heating Load (HL) of residential buildings was investigated using Multiple Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Network (MLR-ANN) approaches. Two-layer hyperbolic tangent-identity transfer functions with 6-3-1 configurations were employed as it was found as the best neural network model. A dataset of 768 residential buildings was used for secondary data. The Mean Square Error (MSE), determination coefficients R2, as well as the percentage of normalized importance analysis were used to assess the statistical prediction capabilities of the MLR-ANN model. Based on the current findings, Wall Area is the most contributing factor towards HL, followed by Relative Compactness, Roof Area, Overall Height, Glazing Area, and Glazing Area Distribution. It can be suggested that HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems should be implemented in residential buildings to reduce energy use. Natural ventilation is encouraged in buildings through vernacular design, and radiant heating and cooling systems as it is very effective and efficient way of providing thermal comfort within a structure.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the building sector has received increasing attention with attempts to limit its energy con­ sumptions and GHG emissions. In fact, buildings account for more than 30\% of the overall energy demand worldwide, with projections for increases in this quota due to climate changes, urbanization, and higher living comfort standards. This study investigates the effects of climate changes on the heating and cooling energy demand of buildings in the most populated urban region in Canada, i.e. the city of Toronto in Ontario. Statistical and dynamical downscaling methods are utilized to generate several future weather files, starting from different baseline climates including the old Canadian Weather Year for Energy Calculation CWEC (representing the 1959–1989 period) and the new CWEC 2016 (representing the 1998–2014 period). In dynamical downscaling, a regional climate model is used to obtain a finer resolution than traditional general circulation models. The generated future weather data sets are then used for simulating the energy demand of 16 building prototypes. The simulation results show an average decrease of 18\%–33\% for the heating energy use intensity, and an average increase of 15\%–126\% for the cooling energy use intensity by 2070, depending on the baseline climatic file of use and building typology. The forecasted GHG emissions of each building prototype are then discussed. The results demonstrate the need to perform building modelling with sensitivity analysis of future climate scenarios in order to design more resilient buildings.},

	abstract = {To tackle increasingly serious environmental issues and satisfy different stakeholders, trade-offs between different goals should be considered in the building planning phase. However, especially during early stages of decision-making, uncertainties are inevitable and should be modeled. Moreover, in real-world decision-making processes, decisions are often not made at the same time. Thus, it is of interest to model the trade-offaware decision-making process that takes uncertainties and different decision stages into account in building planning. In this paper, we conducted a comparative analysis of machine-learning-based and dynamic-buildingsimulation-based methodologies of generating operational energy within a multi-objective stochastic optimization (MOSO-II) framework. Results show that the Paretooptimal solutions with the machine-learning model can withstand a higher degree of uncertainty, which can be explained by higher use energy amount and a larger uncertainty range in the applied dataset caused by occupant behavior or other effects.},

	abstract = {Building thermal load prediction informs the optimization of cooling plant and thermal energy storage. Physicsbased prediction models of building thermal load are constrained by the model and input complexity. In this study, we developed 12 data-driven models (7 shallow learning, 2 deep learning, and 3 heuristic methods) to predict building thermal load and compared shallow machine learning and deep learning. The 12 prediction models were compared with the measured cooling demand. It was found XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boost) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) provided the most accurate load prediction in the shallow and deep learning category, and both outperformed the best baseline model, which uses the previous day’s data for prediction. Then, we discussed how the prediction horizon and input uncertainty would inﬂuence the load prediction accuracy. Major conclusions are twofold: ﬁrst, LSTM performs well in short-term prediction (1 h ahead) but not in long term prediction (24 h ahead), because the sequential information becomes less relevant and accordingly not so useful when the prediction horizon is long. Second, the presence of weather forecast uncertainty deteriorates XGBoost’s accuracy and favors LSTM, because the sequential information makes the model more robust to input uncertainty. Training the model with the uncertain rather than accurate weather data could enhance the model’s robustness. Our ﬁndings have two implications for practice. First, LSTM is recommended for short-term load prediction given that weather forecast uncertainty is unavoidable. Second, XGBoost is recommended for long term prediction, and the model should be trained with the presence of input uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Buildings are one of the significant sources of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission in urban areas all over the world. Lighting control and building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) are two effective measures in reducing overall primary energy consumption and carbon emission during building operation. Due to the complex energy nature of the building, accurate day-ahead prediction of heating, cooling, lighting loads and BIPV electrical power production is essential in building energy management. Owing to the changing me­ trological conditions, diversity and complexity of buildings, building energy load demands and BIPV electrical power production is highly variable. This may lead to poor building energy management, extra primary energy consumption or thermal discomfort. In this study, three machine learning-based multi-objective prediction frameworks are proposed for simultaneous prediction of multiple energy loads. The three machine learning techniques are artificial neural network, support vector regression and long-short-term-memory neural network. Since heating, cooling, lighting loads and BIPV electrical power production share similar affecting factors, it is computational time saving to adopt the proposed multi-objective prediction framework to predict multiple building energy loads and BIPV power production. The ANN-based predictive model results in the smallest mean absolute percentage error while SVM-based one cost the shortest computation time.},

	abstract = {Buildings use up to 40\% of the global primary energy and 30\% of global greenhouse gas emissions, which may signiﬁcantly impact climate change. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are among the most signiﬁcant contributors to global primary energy consumption and carbon gas emissions. Furthermore, HVAC energy demand is expected to rise in the future. Therefore, advancements in HVAC systems’ performance and design would be critical for mitigating worldwide energy and environmental concerns. To make such advancements, energy modeling and model predictive control (MPC) play an imperative role in designing and operating HVAC systems effectively. Building energy simulations and analysis techniques effectively implement HVAC control schemes in the building system design and operation phases, and thus provide quantitative insights into the behaviors of the HVAC energy ﬂow for architects and engineers. Extensive research and advanced HVAC modeling/control techniques have emerged to provide better solutions in response to the issues. This study reviews building energy modeling techniques and state-of-the-art updates of MPC in HVAC applications based on the most recent research articles (e.g., from MDPI’s and Elsevier’s databases). For the review process, the investigation of relevant keywords and contextbased collected data is ﬁrst carried out to overview their frequency and distribution comprehensively. Then, this review study narrows the topic selection and search scopes to focus on relevant research papers and extract relevant information and outcomes. Finally, a systematic review approach is adopted based on the collected review and research papers to overview the advancements in building system modeling and MPC technologies. This study reveals that advanced building energy modeling is crucial in implementing the MPC-based control and operation design to reduce building energy consumption and cost. This paper presents the details of major modeling techniques, including white-box, grey-box, and black-box modeling approaches. This paper also provides future insights into the advanced HVAC control and operation design for researchers in relevant research and practical ﬁelds.},

	abstract = {Residential buildings are a significant source of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, making it crucial to accurately predict their energy demand for reducing their environmental impact. In this study, machine-learning techniques such as linear regression, decision tree classification, logistic regression, and neural networks were applied to forecast the heating and cooling loads of 12 different building types using their area and height attributes. The correlation coefficient was utilized to assign weights to the predictors in linear regression, and the models’ performance was evaluated using metrics such as equations of R2, MAE, and RMSE. The decision tree technique demonstrated the highest accuracy of 98.96\% and 93.24\% for predicting heating and cooling loads, respectively, among the classification methods. Notably, the cooling load prediction was more accurate than the heating load prediction. The height and area of the roof and floor, along with the relative compactness of the building, were identified as the most influential factors in the heating and cooling loads. These findings have significant implications for optimizing energy efficiency in residential buildings and mitigating their impact on climate change.},

	abstract = {In recent years, due to the unnecessary wastage of electrical energy in residential buildings, the requirement of energy optimization and user comfort has gained vital importance. In the literature, various techniques have been proposed addressing the energy optimization problem. The goal of each technique is to maintain a balance between user comfort and energy requirements, such that the user can achieve the desired comfort level with the minimum amount of energy consumption. Researchers have addressed the issue with the help of different optimization algorithms and variations in the parameters to reduce energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is not solved yet due to its challenging nature. The gaps in the literature are due to advancements in technology, the drawbacks of optimization algorithms, and the introduction of new optimization algorithms. Further, many newly proposed optimization algorithms have produced better accuracy on the benchmark instances but have not been applied yet for the optimization of energy consumption in smart homes. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review of the techniques used for the optimization of energy consumption and scheduling in smart homes. Detailed discussion has been carried out on different factors contributing towards thermal comfort, visual comfort, and air quality comfort. We have also reviewed the fog and edge computing techniques used in smart homes.},

	abstract = {A model predictive control system with adaptive machine-learning-based building models for building automation and control applications is proposed. The system features an adaptive machine-learning-based building dynamics modelling scheme that updates the building model regularly using online building operation data through a dynamic artificial neural network with a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous structure. The system also employs a multi-objective function that could optimize both energy efficiency and indoor thermal comfort, two often contradicting demands. The proposed model predictive control system is implemented to control the air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation systems in two single-zone testbeds, an office and a lecture theatre, located in Singapore for experimental evaluation of its control performance. The model predictive control system is compared against the original reactive control system (thermostat in the office and building management system in the lecture theatre) in each testbed. The model predictive control system reduces 58.5\% cooling thermal energy consumption in the office and 36.7\% cooling electricity consumption in the lecture theatre, as compared to their respective original control. Meanwhile, the indoor thermal comfort in both testbeds is also greatly improved by the model predictive control system. Developing a model predictive control system using machine-learning-based building dynamics models could largely cut down the model construction time to days as compared to its counterpart using physics-based models, which usually take months to construct. However, the machine-learning-based modelling approach could be challenged by lack of building operational data necessary for model training in case of model predictive control development before the building has become operational.},

	abstract = {In Korea apartment buildings, most energy is consumed as heating energy. In order to reduce heating energy in apartment buildings, it is required to reduce the amount of energy used in heating systems. Energy saving in heating systems can be achieved through operation and control based on efﬁcient operation plans. The efﬁcient operation plan of the heating system should be based on the predicted heating load. Thus, various methods have been developed for predicting heating loads. Recently, artiﬁcial intelligence techniques (e.g., ANN: artiﬁcial neural network) have been used to predict heating loads. The process for determination of input data variables is necessary to obtain the accuracy of predicted results using an ANN model. However, there is a lack of studies to evaluate the accuracy level of the predicted results caused by the selection and combination of input variables. There is a need to evaluate the performance of an ANN model for prediction of residential heating loads. Therefore, the purpose of this study is, for a residential building, to evaluate the accuracy levels of predicted heating loads using an ANN model with various combinations of input variables. To achieve the study purpose, each case was classiﬁed according to the combination of the input variables and the prediction results were analyzed. Through this, the worst, mean, and best were selected according to the predicted performance. In addition, an actual case was selected consisting of variables that can be measured in an actual building. The derived cv(RMSE) of each case resulted in a percentage value of 38.2\% for the worst, 7.3\% for the mean, 3.0\% for the best, and 5.4\% for the actual. The largest difference between the best and worst resulted in 33.2\%, and thus the precision of the predicted heating loads was highly affected by the selection and combination of the input variables used for the ANN model.},

Our MPC approach uses dynamic estimates and predictions of zone loads and temperatures, outdoor weather conditions, and HVAC system models to minimize energy consumption and cost while meeting equipment and thermal comfort constraints. It includes data-driven building models estimated and validated using data from an actual building, and deploys an optimizer based on constraint linear/quadratic programming with hard comfort bounds that yields a global minimum with predicted exogenous disturbances. The MPC results show 34\% cost savings compared to baseline feedback control during the cooling season and 16\% energy use reduction during the heating season. Also, the radiant floor system with the predictive controller shows 29–50\% energy savings when compared with a baseline air delivery system serving two identical thermal zones located in the same building.},

	abstract = {Building systems are subject of dynamic system that have a general feature of non-linearity and in turn, present us with different challenges for its optimized control of energy-saving and thermal comfort. Occupancy behavior, weather forecast, ambient temperature and solar irradiation, etc. In particular are difficult to predict. These uncertainty parameters have a direct influence on the building’s behavior that further complicate problem formulation for energy saving in a building. Model predictive control (MPC) has been one of the potential strategies for control schemes to address these problems and tackle them since its invention. MPC is a suitable and the best candidate when it comes to questioning for future predictions in terms of energy efficiency, cost, and control mechanisms. MPC consists of model of a plant, prediction horizon and optimization tools used for the optimization of the future response of the plant. After broad applications of MPC in industrial applications for process control, it has been gaining ground in the field of Heating Ventilation and Air-conditioning (HVAC). Although there has been extensive research of MPC in HVAC systems of buildings, there lacks a detailed review, a complete structure that formulates and describes the applications. An overall holistic view of applications of MPC in building HVAC system has been provided in this paper. Broader information on modeling techniques and optimization algorithms are discussed in a detailed manner. Different design parameters such as prediction horizon, time step, cost function, etc., that ultimately affect MPC performance are presented in a comprehensive form. Various kinds of modeling software with their technical features, pros and cons are elaborated. The main goal of the current paper is to highlight important design parameters crucial for the MPC control scheme and provide better guidelines for further studies. Various future outlines have been listed that can be helpful for future work in this field.},

	abstract = {Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is a major energy consumer in buildings. The predictive control has demonstrated a potential to reduce HVAC energy use. To facilitate predictive HVAC control, internal heat gains prediction is required. In this study, we applied Long Short-Term Memory Networks, a special form of deep neural network, to predict miscellaneous electric loads, lighting loads, occupant counts and internal heat gains in two United States office buildings. Compared with the predetermined schedules used in American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standard 90.1, the Long Short-Term Memory Networks method could reduce the prediction errors of internal heat gains from 12\% to 8\% in Building A, and from 26\% to 16\% in Building B. It was also found that for internal heat gains prediction, miscellaneous electric loads is a more important feature than occupant counts for two reasons. First, miscellaneous electric loads is the best proxy variable for internal heat gains, as it is the major component of and has the highest correlation coefficient with the internal heat gains. Second, miscellaneous electric loads contain valuable information to predict occupant count, while occupant count could not help improve miscellaneous electric loads prediction. These findings could help researchers and practitioners select the most relevant features to more accurately predict internal heat gains for the implementation of predictive HVAC control in buildings.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network is optimized with two metaheuristic algorithms, namely Artiﬁcial Bee Colony (ABC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for estimating the heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) of the energy efﬁcient buildings with the residential use. To achieve this, a dataset composed of eight independent factors namely, relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, glazing area distribution, along with the two dependent variables of HL and CL is provided. Out of 768 samples, 80:20 ratio is considered to select the training and testing datasets randomly. Through a trial and error process, the optimal parameters of the MLP, ABC-MLP and PSO-MLP networks are determined. Three well-known criteria including coefﬁcient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are utilized to measure the accuracy of the used models. The results reveal that applying the ABC and PSO algorithms, helps the MLP to perform more efﬁciently. In this sense, the increase of R2 from 0.8933 to 0.9349 and 0.9370 for the HL, and from 0.8872 to 0.8969 and 0.8997 for the CL prediction show that the outputs of the ensemble models (i.e., ABC-MLP and PSO-MLP) are more correlated with the actual data. Also, the MAE decreases as 22.32\% and 24.28\% for the HL, and 10.36\% and 12.00\% for the CL respectively by applying the ABC and PSO. Besides, the RSME decreases as 22.48\% and 23.86\% for the HL, and 6.06\% and 7.56\% for the CL modeling respectively with using the ABC and PSO. It is also deduced that the PSO outperforms the ABC in the performance enhancement of the MLP.},

Therefore, this study investigated comprehensive trade-oﬀ between performances of commonly used forecasting models based on multiple performance metrics. Considering the requirements of actual building energy system, the objectives included accuracy, interpretability, robustness, and eﬃciency. With actual heating energy, prediction models were established by applying extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and support vector regression (SVR). A comparison revealed the following: 1) RF exhibits optimal average accuracy (under diﬀerent training datasets), whereas ANN exhibits contrary properties. 2) The robustness of RF is the highest from adaptation to diﬀerent training datasets with minimum standard deviation of error; XGBoost and ANN exhibit contrary properties. 3) RF, GBDT, and XGBoost are rendered eﬀectively interpretable. 4) At equivalent accuracy level, ANN and SVR require auxiliary algorithms, whereas other models can achieve reasonable accuracy no tuning required. BPNN's calculation time is of an order magnitude higher than those of other models. Overall, XGBoost exhibits the optimal eﬃciency. This study can provide guidance for eﬀectively selecting prediction models for energy management.},

	abstract = {In the current technological era, energy-eﬃcient buildings have a signiﬁcant research body due to increasing concerns about energy consumption and its environmental impact. Designing an appropriate energy-eﬃcient building depends on its layout, such as relative compactness, overall area, height, orientation, and distribution of the glazing area. These factors directly inﬂuence the cooling load (CL) and heating load (HL) of residential buildings. An accurate prediction of these load facilitates a better management of energy consumption and enhances the living standards of inhabitants. Most of the traditional machine learning (ML)-based approaches are designed for single-output (SO) prediction, which is a tedious task due to separate training processes for each output with low performance. In addition, these approaches have a high level of nonlinearity between input and output, which need more enhancement in terms of robustness, predictability, and generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework based on gated recurrent unit (GRU) that reliably predicts the CL and HL concurrently. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to propose a multi-output (MO) sequential learning model followed by utility preprocessing under the umbrella of a uniﬁed framework. A comprehensive set of ablation studies on ML and deep learning (DL) techniques is done over an energy eﬃciency dataset, where the proposed model reveals an incredible performance as compared to other existing models.},

	abstract = {The heating load calculation is the ﬁrst step of the iterative heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) design procedure. In this study, we employed six machine learning techniques, namely multi-layer perceptron regressor (MLPr), lazy locally weighted learning (LLWL), alternating model tree (AMT), random forest (RF), ElasticNet (ENet), and radial basis function regression (RBFr) for the problem of designing energy-eﬃcient buildings. After that, these approaches were used to specify a relationship among the parameters of input and output in terms of the energy performance of buildings. The calculated outcomes for datasets from each of the above-mentioned models were analyzed based on various known statistical indexes like root relative squared error (RRSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coeﬃcient (R2), and relative absolute error (RAE). It was found that between the discussed machine learning-based solutions of MLPr, LLWL, AMT, RF, ENet, and RBFr, the RF was nominated as the most appropriate predictive network. The RF network outcomes determined the R2, MAE, RMSE, RAE, and RRSE for the training dataset to be 0.9997, 0.19, 0.2399, 2.078, and 2.3795, respectively. The RF network outcomes determined the R2, MAE, RMSE, RAE, and RRSE for the testing dataset to be 0.9989, 0.3385, 0.4649, 3.6813, and 4.5995, respectively. These results show the superiority of the presented RF model in estimation of early heating load in energy-eﬃcient buildings.},

	abstract = {The real-time management and control of heating-system networks in residential buildings has tremendous energy-saving potential, and accurate load prediction is the basis for system monitoring. In this regard, selecting the appropriate input parameters is the key to accurate heating-load forecasting. In existing models for forecasting heating loads and selecting input parameters, with an increase in the length of the prediction cycle, the heating-load rate gradually decreases, and the inﬂuence of the outside temperature gradually increases. In view of different types of solutions for improving buildings’ energy efﬁciency, this study proposed a Energy-efﬁciency model for residential buildings based on gradient descent optimization (E2B-GDO). This model can predict a building’s heating-load conservation based on a building energy performance dataset. The input layer includes area (distribution of the glazing area, wall area, and surface area), relative density, and overall elevation. The proposed E2B-GDO model achieved an accuracy of 99.98\% for training and 98.00\% for validation.},

Continuously improving and enhancing the performance of forecasting models is the key to ensuring the performance sustainability of energy systems. In this connection, the current paper presented a new improved hybrid model of machine learning application for forecasting the cooling load (CL) and the heating load (HL) of residential buildings after studying and analyzing various types of CL and HL forecasting models. The proposed hybrid model, called group support vector regression (GSVR), is a combination of group method of data handling (GMDH) and support vector regression (SVR) models. To forecast CL and HL, this study also made use of base methods such as back-propagation neural network (BPNN), elastic-net regression (ENR), general regression neural network (GRNN), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), partial least squares regression (PLSR), GMDH, and SVR. The technical parameters of the building were utilized as input variables of the forecasting models, and the CL and HL were adopted as the output variables of each network. All models were saved in the form of black box after training and initial testing. Finally, comparative analysis was performed to assess the predictive performance of the suggested model and the well-known basic models. Based on the results, the proposed hybrid method with high correlation coefﬁcient (R) (e.g. R=99.92\% for CL forecasting and R=99.99\% for HL forecasting) and minimal statistical error values provided the most optimal prediction performance.},

Some previous methods have been proposed for predicting building energy loads using traditional machine learning methods. However, these traditional methods suffer from overﬁtting problems, which leads to inaccurate prediction results. To achieve high accuracy results, an ensemble learning approach is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach uses an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to avoid overﬁtting problems and builds an efﬁcient prediction model. An extensive experiment is conducted on a selected dataset of residential building designs to evaluate the proposed approach. The dataset consists of 768 samples of eight input attributes (overall height, relative compactness, wall area, surface area, roof area, glazing area distribution, glazing area, and orientation) and two output responses (cooling load (CL) and heating load (HL)). The experimental results prove that the proposed approach achieves the highest prediction performance, which will help building managers and engineers make better decisions regarding building energy loads.},

Then, the mentioned methods are utilised to identify a relationship between the input and output parameters of the EEB system. The amount of CL was taken as the essential output of the EEB system, while the input parameters were channel length, channel depth, channel width, and air mass flow rate. The predicted results for data sets from each of the abovementioned models were evaluated according to several known statistical indices such as correlation coefficient (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), relative absolute error (RAE), and root relative squared error (RRSE) as well as novel ranking systems of colour intensity rating and total ranking method. The M5Rules has been proposed as the best predictive network in this study. The results of the M5Rules network indicated the R2, MAE, RMSE, RAE, and RRSE for the training and testing data sets were 0.9982, 0.0426, 0.0653, 6.2344, and 6.0298 and 0.7626, 0.9903, 0.9593, and 0.9981, respectively. According to R2, RMSE, and VAF, values of 0.99983, 0.0066, and 99.98 and 0.9982, 0.065, and 84.5 were obtained for testing data set and values of proposed PSO-M5Rules prediction network models, respectively.

On the other hand, stochastic algorithms have recently shown high proﬁciency in dealing with this issue. These are the reasons that this study is dedicated to evaluating an innovative hybrid method for predicting the cooling load (CL) in buildings with residential usage. The proposed model is a combination of artiﬁcial neural networks and stochastic fractal search (SFS–ANNs). Two benchmark algorithms, namely the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) and ﬁreﬂy algorithm (FA) are also considered to be compared with the SFS. The non-linear effect of eight independent factors on the CL is analyzed using each model’s optimal structure. Evaluation of the results outlined that all three metaheuristic algorithms (with more than 90\% correlation) can adequately optimize the ANN. In this regard, this tool’s prediction error declined by nearly 23\%, 18\%, and 36\% by applying the GOA, FA, and SFS techniques. Moreover, all used accuracy criteria indicated the superiority of the SFS over the benchmark schemes. Therefore, it is inferred that utilizing the SFS along with ANN provides a reliable hybrid model for the early prediction of CL.},

In this study, three novel hybrid intelligent methods, namely the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), wind-driven optimization (WDO), and biogeography-based optimization (BBO), are employed to optimize the multitarget prediction of heating loads (HLs) and cooling loads (CLs) in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Concerning the optimization of the applied algorithms, a series of swarm-based iterations are performed, and the best structure is proposed for each model. The GOA, WDO, and BBO algorithms are mixed with a class of feedforward artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs), which is called a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict the HL and CL.

However, there is little evidence backed up by measured data to validate the actual effectiveness of BEES in China. Using survey data collected from 1128 households in Chongqing China, this study applied the propensity scores matching method to estimate the effect of two BEES levels: the 50\%-BEES (low level) and the 65\%-BEES (high level). Results show that buildings built with 65\%-BEES, on average, can reduce cooling and heating electricity use intensity (kWh/m2/a) by 41\%, compared to buildings in the absence of the BEES. Meanwhile, the adoption of 50\%-BEES can reduce cooling and heating electricity use intensity (kWh/m2/a) by 38\%. However, energy savings are not significant if comparing buildings with 65\%-BEES and 50\%-BEES. The results indicate that there exists a performance gap between calculated design performance savings and actual operation energy savings. These empirical findings provide policymakers with valuable feedback on buildings' actual performance. The findings suggest that it is necessary to incorporate outcome-based compliance pathways into the current BEES system. Lastly, a data-driven building policy evaluation mechanism should be developed in China. Energy consumption databases should be developed to support policies such as building energy codes and standards' development and performance evaluation.},

To enhance the energy efficiency of buildings, this paper proposes an approach to predict building energy consumption based on the design of the building envelope. The design parameters of the building envelope include the comprehensive heat transfer coefficient and solar radiation absorption coefficient of exterior walls, comprehensive heat transfer coefficient and solar radiation absorption coefficient of the roof, comprehensive heat transfer coefficient of outer windows, and window-wall ratio. The approach is applied to optimize the design parameters of the building envelope structure of a university teaching building in northern China. First, a building information model of a teaching building is established in Revit and imported into DesignBuilder energy consumption analysis software. Subsequently, a data set of the abovementioned 6 parameters is obtained by performing orthogonal testing and energy consumption simulations. On this basis, an RF model is used to predict building energy consumption and rank the importance of each parameter, and the Pearson function is used to evaluate the corresponding correlations. The results show that the most important parameters with the highest correlations to building energy consumption are the comprehensive heat transfer coefficients of the exterior walls and outer windows and the window-wall ratio. Finally, the RF prediction results are compared to the prediction results of a BP artificial neural network (BP-ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The findings indicate that the RF model exhibits notable advantages in building energy consumption prediction and is the optimal prediction model among the compared models.},

	abstract = {Three main groups of internal and external influencing factors have been identified through this review, including building characteristics, equipment and technologies, and occupant’s behaviors. The consideration of only building characteristics cannot guarantee the best energy design of a building, as it could be dependent on the other two groups of factors. Under some circumstances, some of the energy efficiency design solutions did not consider economic or environmental benefits. A wide range of advanced technologies is available for building designers, while challenges still exist from a cost-effectiveness perspective. Many numerical results are hard to validate and confirm the feasibility of those real projects. Comparatively, occupant behavior interventions provide an alternative solution for building users to improve energy efficiency with a relatively low cost and unsophisticated construction procedures. According to those reviewed studies, the ranges of energy-saving are 10-28\% and 43-71\% through the smart control of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and the lighting systems, respectively. The trends of key influencing factors on energy efficiency design have slightly changed over the past few decades. The influencing factors had been mainly investigated in the optimization design and technological updates of buildings previously but now have incorporated the building management of occupant behaviour. Few studies have been carried out to integrate the occupant behavior model into the current energy simulation software. Thus, two research directions can be concluded after this review. Building efficiency design needs to be conducted from a systematic view to figure out the underlying issues among different efficient design measures. Energy performance benchmarking of both occupant behavior interventions and the technological updates and building service systems are urgently needed as a guided reference to help the building users to make smart decisions.},

From a system-level perspective, such programs reduce costs, enhance reliability, and reduce network issues. Similarly, DSM programs help participating customers reduce utility bills while maintaining occupant comfort. Understanding the relationship between EE and DF is key to realizing the full potential of DSM programs. In this study, we modeled an all-electric residential community based on a 498-home community that is planned for construction in Fort Collins, Colorado in the United States. We used this community model to study the relationship between different EE measures, including building envelope upgrades and smart appliances, and DF enabled by a home energy management system (HEMS) responding to a time-varying tariff. Various EE levels in the homes – codeminimum, zero energy ready, and even higher levels of envelope efficiency – were simulated. DF is enabled by the HEMS, which coordinates behind-the-meter resources, including flexible building loads, PV, and home battery systems, to minimize utility bills while maintaining occupant comfort. When comparing to the codeminimum homes, EE upgrades alone reduce HVAC energy use during peak hours by up to 50\% and the HVAC utility bill by up to \$312/year. With the addition of HEMS, the average daily peak demand can be reduced by up to 0.58 MW or 1.2 kW/home in the higher envelope efficiency homes. The combination of EE upgrades, HEMS, and home battery systems is expected to save homeowners up to \$590/year while increasing community load flexibility. However, HEMS and home battery systems are less effective in increasing the DF in the more efficient homes due to the lower load.},

	abstract = {Since cooling and heating loads are regarded as signiﬁcant parameters to examine the energy performance of buildings, the need to predict and analyze them for the residential buildings seems to be undeniable. Hence, the present paper wants to optimize the multi-layer perceptron neural network using several optimization methods to predict the heating and cooling of energy-efﬁcient buildings. The dataset used in this study consists of eight independent factors: surface area, wall area, roof area, relative compactness, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution. To prove the reliability and accuracy of the obtained results, test and training data are also considered. According to the statistical results, biogeography-based optimization has the highest value of R2 and the lowest values of RMSD, normalized RMSD, and MAE in both training data and test data for cooling and heating loads. Hence, the forecasting accuracy of the proposed MLP neural network optimized with the BBO optimization algorithm with the RMSD, R2, and MAE of 2.82, 0.920, 2.15 in the training phase of heating load and with the RMSD, R2, and MAE of 3.18, 0.887, 2.97 in the training phase of the cooling load is much better than those of the other models.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been recognised as a powerful method for modelling building energy consumption. The capability of ML to provide a fast and accurate prediction of energy loads makes it an ideal tool for decisionmaking tasks related to sustainable design and retroﬁt planning. However, the accuracy of these ML models is dependent on the selection of the right hyper-parameters for a speciﬁc building dataset. This paper proposes a method for optimising ML models for forecasting both heating and cooling loads. The technique employs multiobjective optimisation with evolutionary algorithms to search the space of possible parameters. The proposed approach not only tunes single model to precisely predict building energy loads but also accelerates the process of model optimisation. The study utilises simulated building energy data generated in EnergyPlus to validate the proposed method, and compares the outcomes with the regular ML tuning procedure (i.e. grid search). The optimised model provides a reliable tool for building designers and engineers to explore a large space of the available building materials and technologies.},

	abstract = {Data-driven models can estimate the buildings’ energy consumption using machine learning algorithms. This approach works based on the correlation between energy consumption and various inputs such as weather data, occupancy schedules, heating, air conditioning, and physical properties of buildings. Seasonal changes affect buildings’ energy use. Hence, the required data for data-driven models (DDMs) during the heating and cooling days could be different. Selecting the most impactful inputs can help to choose the type and quantity of sensors for deployment that improve the model’s accuracy and minimize the costs. This paper performs feature selection for heating, cooling, hot water, and ventilation loads in residential buildings under the mixed-humid climate zone. Filter method, wrapper backward elimination, wrapper recursive feature elimination, Lasso regression, linear regression, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression are adopted for heating and cooling days, separately. We use twenty-ﬁve outputs from a computer model, and the results show that the key features for a DDM are different for heating and cooling days, and XGBoost provides the most accurate forecast. The ﬁndings of this paper are useful for selecting proper models, sensors, and inputs for model-predictive control systems during the heating and cooling seasons.},

	abstract = {Heating load prediction of district heating (DH) can give the heating demand, guide the strategies formulation and avoid excessive heat. However, existing prediction models from the supply side are to learn historical inefﬁcient operations and have no energy-saving effect. Therefore, this study proposes the demand-side method, which predicts the heating load of terminal buildings considering inﬂuence of indoor temperature. Dynamic and steady-state white box model are taken as prediction techniques due to inapplicability of data-driven model, and model calibration is used to match the models accurately with the actual. Taking an actual residential building as the case, and the results show steady-state model has application advantages over dynamic model due to the greatly reduced calculation time under the situation of limited known information, although the accuracy of dynamic model is slightly better than that of steady-state model. The steady-state model can predict the heating load under different indoor temperature. The energy-saving rate reducing the actual indoor temperature to 18  C is 11\%e27\% for different periods of a heating season. The method is a novel way to conduct load prediction for DH with energy-saving effect, and provides a meaningful basis for formulating heating strategies.},

	abstract = {Energy-saving is a global challenge and one of the hot research topics of this decade. The need for sustainable technologies and solutions for energy-saving dramatically increased in residential buildings due to population growth, quality of indoor environment, and climate change. Recently, IoT based applications have been developed in smart homes, smart cities, smart hospitals, and other smart environments. The goals of sustainable technologies in residential buildings incorporate maximization of thermal comfort and minimizing energy consumption. The challenges and problems of residential buildings can be solved using consumer behavior models and integrating their inference into residential problem solutions. This paper proposes an IoT task management mechanism based on predictive optimization for energy consumption minimization in smart residential buildings. The proposed task management mechanism has a predictive optimization module based on prediction and an optimization module for solving energy consumption minimization problems. The energy data is obtained from different appliances to evaluate the proposed predictive optimization approach. The proposed approach results are compared with prediction and optimization modules. The performance is evaluated in terms of regression performance metrics. The case study results show that the predictive optimization mechanism based on task management performs better than standalone prediction and optimization-based energy consumption mechanisms in residential buildings.},

	abstract = {Ventilation has proved to be an effective solution for reducing building cooling load in high-rise buildings, i.e. ventilative cooling (VC), especially in cold climates. Mechanical ventilation system can achieve VC (i.e. mechanical VC) in high-rise buildings, but it needs appropriate control to reduce cooling related energy consumption and to consider the impact of climate change. This study aims to develop an optimal control method for mechanical VC and evaluate its energy performance, based on an advanced model. In this advanced model, a machine learning model was applied to predict building cooling load and energy models were developed to predict energy consumption. A case study was conducted on a real high-rise building located in Montreal (Canada). Using the measured data from the Building Automation System (BAS), the machine learning model, generated by an algorithm called Gradient tree boosting (GTB), was found to be the most accurate and was used in the optimal control method. The energy models that couple mechanical ventilation and chiller cooling were validated with the BAS measured data. Then, the optimal control method was applied to study the energy performance of mechanical VC under long-term climate conditions. The results indicate that the energy savings of mechanical VC will decrease around 16\% during the summer but increase around 105\% during the shoulder season due to climate change. The optimal nominal ventilation rate for mechanical VC in the typical meteorological year is twice of that in the 2080 s A1FI weather scenario.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of the building load is crucial to ensure the energy saving and improve the operational efficiency of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. In this study, the heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) of buildings are analyzed using the Spearman method considering eight influencing fac­ tors: relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution. The ant colony optimization (ACO) method is used to optimize the ability of a wavelet neural network (WNN) to predict the HL and CL values of residential buildings. The linearly decreasing inertia weight and self-adaptive mutation operator are introduced to improve the optimizing capability of the ACO. An improved ACO-WNN (I-ACO-WNN) model is proposed to achieve a high-precision building load forecasting, and the formulas including the influence factors of the building load, are proposed. The regression coefficient values of the proposed forecasting model of HL and CL are 0.9714 and 0.9783, respectively. Compared to the traditional WNN model, the root mean square error values of HL and CL predictions by the I-ACO-WNN model are decreased by 66.01\% and 73.28\%, respectively; while the mean absolute error values are decreased by 82.44\% and 84.82\%, respectively; also, the mean absolute percentage error values are reduced by 81.21\% and 85.31\%, respectively; lastly, the mean square error values are reduced by 88.44\% and 92.86\%, respectively. The proposed prediction model can be used as a reliable tool for HL and CL estimation in future intelligent urban planning.},

In this paper, a neighbourhoodscale building simulation coupled between building energy simulation and CFD is proposed to assess the impact of external convective heat transfer coefﬁcient (CHTC) to the building thermal performance. The co-simulation is run for different types of buildings inside the neighbourhood with different combinations of neighbourhood form parameters. The developed simulation scheme allows the iterations of neighbourhood design parameters and simulation model generation in CFD and EnergyPlus. Five empirical methods are used to predict CHTC, and the results of CHTC values, heating and cooling load intensity are compared in detail with the proposed CFD coupled method. The results suggest that the orientation and multiplier are crucial to the building load intensity in Chicago and the neighbourhood form can affect the thermal load of residential building up to about þ27.1\% and À18.6\%, and þ17.2\% and À7.7\% for ofﬁce buildings. The proposed method and framework in this paper is capable of generating design guidelines for the optimal energy performance of the buildings in the neighbourhood.},

	abstract = {Accurate building cooling load prediction is beneficial in managing optimal operation to conserve energy user and operational cost. Several physics-based and data-driven models proposed to forecast building cooling load focus on one-step-ahead prediction. Deep learning-based Long-term memory (LSTM) models are shown to perform well for one-step short-term (1Hour Ahead) building cooling load prediction. However, no prior studies have examined the prediction performance of shallow machine learning methods over deep learning models to forecast building cooling demand over multisteps across diverse real-world datasets. A multi-step model learns a single parametric function from input time series and forecasts an array of building cooling load values (multi-step) simultaneously. A comprehensive study has been carried out to evaluate the performance of six data-driven models (2 shallow learning, 3 deep sequential learning, and 1 heuristic method) to predict multi-step long-term (1Day Ahead) building cooling load. Our results demonstrate variant of the LSTM model, the Recurrent Neural Network Multi-Input Multi-Output (RNN-MIMO) network architecture, performs consistently well compared to its deep learning counterparts and shallow machine learning techniques, both tree boosting and support vector regression. Notable conclusions from results obtained are twofold: Firstly, Long short-term memory (LSTM) based RNN-MIMO architecture performs well in both short-term (1Hour Ahead) and long-term (1Day Ahead) multi-step forecast horizon. RNN-MIMO is up to 33\% more accurate, on average, in terms of mean absolute error over existing, state-of-the-art shallow machine learning models both Support Vector Regression (SVR) and tree boosting techniques (XGBoost). Our findings have significant implications for practice. Notably, machine learning models trained on onestep-ahead predictions cannot be deployed readily to predict multiple time steps into the future since longer prediction horizons impose additional training and fine-tuning efforts over each of the multiple steps. RNN-MIMO model’s ability to predict multiple time steps simultaneously eliminates the need for manual fine-tuning of individual models for each required forecast horizon.},
